# anti-PD1_ESCC

## Summary
Neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade (NICB) has shown promise in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the factors that render certain patients more responsive to NICB with complete regression/response (CR) remains elusive. We applied single-cell RNA-sequencing to examine tumors from patients with ESCC before and after NICB from a phase 2 clinical trial. We identiﬁed key tumor immune microenvironment subpopulations relevant to CR, along with candidate cell-cell interactions. Speciﬁcally, we linked exhausted SPRY1+CD8+T cells in ESCC to progenitor phenotype and CR prediction under NICB, as validated by multiplex immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry in a prospective cohort. Additionally, we elucidated its critical interactions regulating the proinflammatory phenotype of macrophages and the functional state of B cells, which in turn promoted antitumor immunity by enhancing CD8+T cell effector functions. Our data shed light on tumor microenvironment in effective response to NICB for ESCC and provide foundational resources for future mechanistic studies.
